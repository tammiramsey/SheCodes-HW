        <h1>Lodi, Ohio </h1>
        <h3>Lodi is a small village in northeast Ohio.
            <br>
            It was once named Harrisville, but was later renamed due to this name already being used in Ohio, which was causing confusion for the postal service. 
            <br>
            Legend has it that someone at the town meeting started reciting the poem "Napoleon at the Bridge," which is the narration of the Battle of Lodi, Italy.
