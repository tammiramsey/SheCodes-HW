    <h1>Knitting</h1>
    <h2>One of my creative hobbies</h2>

    <p>
Knitting is a method for production of textile fabrics by interlacing yarn loops with loops of the same or other yarns.
It is used to create many types of garments. Knitting may be done by hand or by machine. Knitting creates stitches:
loops of yarn in a row, either flat or in the round.
